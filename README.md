## Goals
Given a mocked customers API, we want to:
- List Customers & their favorite venues
- Filter Customers by age
- Add new Customers

## Implementation
THIS PROJECT WAS MADE IN 10 HOURS or LESS starting FE from scratch, it's not perfect, the idea is to show some main concepts
*NO THIRD PARTY LIBRARIES WERE USED ON THIS PROJECT

My idea was to demostrate:
- Ability to wire an application from scatch
- Knowledge on react using hooks
- Knowledge on wiring & using redux w/ hooks
- Knowledge on sass & good practices
- Knowledge about Animations
- Knowledge about scaffolding and general good practices

## Notes
- Responsiveness was out of scope

## Visual Proof
