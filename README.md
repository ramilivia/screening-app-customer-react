## Goals
Given a mocked customers API, we want to:
- List Customers & their favorite venues
- Filter Customers by age
- Add new Customers

## Implementation
THIS PROJECT WAS MADE IN 10 HOURS or LESS starting FE from scratch, it's not perfect, the idea is to show some main concepts
No third party libraries were used on this project

My idea was to demostrate:
- Ability to wire an application from scatch
- Knowledge on react using hooks
- Knowledge on wiring & using redux w/ hooks
- Knowledge on sass & good practices
- Knowledge about Animations
- Knowledge about scaffolding and good practices

## Notes
- Responsiveness was out of scope


## Installation and running the project

To run first install dependencies:
`yarn install` or `npm install`

Then start the project with:
`yarn start` or `npm start`
